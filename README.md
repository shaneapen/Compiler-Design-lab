# KTU Compiler Design Lab Programs

1. Design and implement a lexical analyzer for given language using C and the lexical analyzer should ignore reduntant sapces, tabsa and new-lines.
2. Implement the above lexical analyzer using a LEX tool.
3. Generate YACC specifaiction for a few syntactic categories: (a). Pgm to recognize a valid arithmetic epression that uses operator +,-,* and / (b). Pgm to recognzie a valid variable which stands with a letter followed by any no. of letters or digits. (c). Implementation of calculator using LEX and YACC. (d). Convert the BNF rules into YACC form and writre code to generate abstract syntax tree.
4. Write a Pgm to conert NFA to DFA.
5. Write a Pgm to minimize any given DFA.
6. Develop an operator precedence parser for a given language.
7. Write program to find simulate first and follow of any given grammar.
8. Construct a recursive decent parser for an expression.
9. Construct a shift reduce parser for a given language.
10. Write a Pgm to perform loop unrolling.
11. Write a Pgm to perform contant propogation.
